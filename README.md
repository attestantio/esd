## Install

### Binaries

Binaries for the latest version of `esd` can be obtained from [the releases page](https://github.com/attestantio/esd/releases/latest).

### Docker

You can obtain the latest version of `esd` using docker with:

```
docker pull attestantio/esd
```

### Source

`esd` is a standard Go binary which can be installed with:

```sh
go get github.com/attestantio/esd
```

# Usage

# Requirements to run `esd`
## Beacon node
`esd` supports all beacon nodes that support the beacon API.

# Configuring `esd`
The minimal requirements for `esd` are references to the beacon node, for example:

```
esd --eth2client.address=localhost:5051
```

Here, 'eth2client.address' is the address of a supported beacon client node (gRPC for Prysm, HTTP for Teku and Lighthouse).

To be useful, `esd` should be supplied with the names of scripts to run when slashings are detected.  A configuration file containing this is shown below:

```yaml
eth2client:
  address: 'localhost:5051'
slashings:
  attester-slashed-script: '/home/esd/scripts/attester-slashed.sh'
  proposer-slashed-script: '/home/esd/scripts/proposer-slashed.sh'
```

These scripts are called when attester and proposer slashings are found on the beacon chain.  The scripts are passed a single argument, which is the index of the validator for which the slashing has been obtained.
